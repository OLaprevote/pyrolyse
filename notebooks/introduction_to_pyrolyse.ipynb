    "## What is pyrolyse?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyrolyse is a package to run alongside [PyRosetta](https://www.pyrosetta.org), a protein design python package built over [Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Current PyRosetta automatically converts the whole C++ of Rosetta into a python library, eventually with a few functions and methods added on top. This results in a package not fully using Python syntactic features. Pyrolyse is a module to import after PyRosetta and to use in parallel: it brings minor modifications to PyRosetta python API by dynamically assigning variables and monkey-patching others. Modifications are only syntactic: PyRosetta still works (hopefully) as efficiently as before, but as the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) states: readability counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes introduced in pyrolyse are similar to the ones introduced in `pyrosetta.bindings`, pushed a step further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Showcase\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is a simple PyRosetta script. It is a possible answer to a problem given in the [notebook 5.02](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks/blob/master/student-notebooks/05.02-Refinement-Protocol.ipynb) of [PyRosetta.notebooks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks).

    "    5. Monte Carlo Metropolis criterion\n",
    "    6. Repeat 1-5 100 times\n",
    "    7. Repeat 1-6 five times, each time decreasing the magnitude of the small and shear moves from 25° to 5° in 5° increments.\n",

    "The differences introduced are small, but it is hoped that by implementing small changes in syntaxes pyrolyse can make scripting with PyRosetta a smoother experience for the writer as well as for the reader, while not breaking too many habits of seasoned users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick How-to\n",
    "\n",
    "Just write `import pyrolyse.all as lys` in the import section, it will change how PyRosetta objects behave. Explanations and more complex uses are described in [How to use pyrolyse](#How-to-use-pyrolyse).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some methods become attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "  Methods which only get or get/set values without any additional argument were simply transformed into attributes, e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pose.pdb_info().name()\n",
    "pose.pdb_info().name('foo')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes after pyrolyse import\n",
    "\n",

    "pose.pdb_info.name\n",
    "pose.pdb_info.name = 'foo'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Methods standing there to have read-only attributes remain read-only. As getting and setting variables is just calling their `__get__` and `__set__` methods, type restrictions remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every method simply returning a value without any argument were converted to attribute. For example, any verbal method was kept as is, like `pose.residue(1).is_backbone()` or even `pose.residue(1).connected_residue_as_lower()` using past-participal form. This follows what is done in built-in python methods like `\"12\".isdigit()` (except past-participal form: this is open to discussion).\n",
    "  \n",
    "To be noted that methods which may take an argument (except for setting) are still methods, so it is `pose.sequence` but `pose.annotated_sequence()`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This improves readability as the intent is clearly stated. Not only that: whether in jupyter notebooks or in an interactive python console, tab completion allows to see which element is a method and which an attribute. This makes different elements purpose clearer.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Again, **this feature is not yet implemented and is currently wishful thinking.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a great introduction to another feature: keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments do exist in C++, yet it is either lost in translation into python or there just aren't many in Rosetta to begin with. In pure PyRosetta, making a movemap with backbone, jumps and chis allowed to move would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mmap = pyr.movemap()\n",
    "mmap.set_bb(True)\n",
    "mmap.set_jump(True)\n",
    "mmap.set_chi(True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now it can be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mmap = pyr.movemap(bb=True, jump=True, chi=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These new arguments were also introduced in movers, for example `MinMover`. Still in the showcase, in pure PyRosetta version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min_mv = ros.protocols.minimization_packing.MinMover()\n",
    "min_mv.movemap(mmap)\n",
    "min_mv.score_function(sfxn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can already see where this is going. However this is cheating, this time someone could actually write in pure PyRosetta:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min_mv = ros.protocols.minimization_packing.MinMover(movemap_in=mmap,\n",
    "                                                     score_fxn_in=sfxn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords aren't even needed. But in pure PyRosetta, it isn't possible to specify one argument only and give the other one later. Why would anyone want to do that? No idea, but at least it's possible with pyrolyse:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min_mv = lys.movers.min_pack.MinMover(sfxn=sfxn)\n",
    "min_mv.movemap = mmap\n",
    "print(min_mv.movemap, min_mv.sfxn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`sfxn` instead of `score_function` is healthy laziness. The abbreviation is already spread everywhere in [PyRosetta.notebooks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, one little yet practical change is the SequenceMover taking movers as a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "seq_mv = pyr.SequenceMover(movers=[small_mv]*4 + [shear_mv]*2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In pure PyRosetta, this would either give:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "seq_mv = pyr.SequenceMover()\n",
    "repeat_small = pyr.RepeatMover(small_mv, 4)\n",
    "repeat_shear = pyr.RepeatMover(shear_mv, 2)\n",
    "seq_mv.add_mover(repeat_small)\n",
    "seq_mv.add_mover(repeat_shear)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, python-flavored (wich is what happens under the hood here):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "seq_mv = pyr.SequenceMover()\n",
    "for mover in [small_mv]*4 + [shear_mv]*2:\n",
    "    seq_mv.add_mover(mover)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This also makes it quite easier to apply a large sequence of movers to a pose:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "long_sequence_of_movers = [first_mv, second_mv, ..., nth_mv]\n",
    "seq_mv = pyr.SequenceMover(movers=long_sequence_of_movers)\n",
    "seq_mv(pose)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Althoug once again, a one-liner would also be possible (would work in pure PyRosetta and with pyrolyse):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(lambda mover: getattr(mover, apply)(pose), long_sequence_of_movers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movers are callable\n",
    "\n",
    "It may have been noticed two examples above. Only movers modified by pyrolyse, though. Calling them is equivalent to calling `apply` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "`import pyrolyse.all` transforms PyRosetta objects, hence `pyrolyse` module organization doesn't need to mirror PyRosetta one. PyRosetta organizes things by general theme, like `pyrosetta.rosetta.protocols.simple_moves` containing every objects worthy of being in the theme `simple_moves`, be it Movers, MoverCreators or ThermodynamicData. It makes sense given that many modules are developed by independent laboratories. Instead, pyrolyse organizes this by objects first, so `pyrolyse.movers.simple` contains every movers from `simple_moves` and only the movers, and `pyrolyse.movers` contains every movers edited by pyrolyse. Also, pyrolyse goal is to make PyRosetta use easier when doing protein design, so it can be a bit flattened as it intends to \"only\" deal with `core` and `protocols` modules and not `utility`, `basics`, `apps`, `platform` or `numeric`, or so it is hoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way users are provided with an alternative: if someone believes the PyRosetta imports are always clearer, then they can keep using them while using the other functionalities of pyrolyse, but if it is believed that this particular time it will be shorter and more understandable to import from pyrolyse then please go on. Hopefully the [showcase](#With-pyrolyse) shows how useful it can be to be able to combine both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings follow numpydoc standards\n",
    "\n",
    "[Numpydoc standards](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) are already used by several structural biology python packages, including [ParmEd](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd), [MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis), [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm/openmm), [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj) and [pyEMMA](https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because class are dynamically changed, the easiest way to know if you are dealing with a PyRosetta or pyrolyse object is either to call an attribute and see if it throws an error or not, or alternatively to use `help` or `?` on the object and see if the doc is different.\n",

This way, if someone wants to only work with PyRosetta `Pose` normal behavior but `MoveMap` and `Movers` with pyrolyze behavior, it would be possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "Changes to MoveMap were explained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full python logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently every logs of Rosetta, regardless of their level, are outputed at `INFO` log level when using the python logging handler, hence it is either everything or nothing. It would be interesting to convert warnings to warnings, infos to infos and debugs to debugs and to be able to switch between them. One dirty possible way to do it would be to set `pyrosetta.logging_support.PythonLoggingSink` to set the log  level of `logstring` depending on present keywords, like `WARNING`, but it should first be explored if there is not a more elegant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea would be to have a module variable `pyrolyse.LOG` which stores any logs outputs at `INFO` level or more. The variable would be limited to a maximal size and could be checked if one had a problem while not outputing logs. This could be especially handy in case of long processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residue method to get AtomID\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyRosetta, some methods may ask for an `AtomID`, for example `pose.set_xyz()`.\n",
    "It would seem only natural to try getting an AtomID with `pose.residue(1).atoms(1)` or `pose.residue(1).atom_index(\"N\")` or similar. This would return an `Atom` object, though. To get an `AtomID` , the `Atom` object has to be written:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "atm_id = pyr.AtomID(pose.residue(1).atom_index('N'), pose.residue(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead it would be interesting to write a method `pose.residue(1).atom_id(1)` and `pose.residue(1).atom_id('N')` returning an `AtomID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digest\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the easiest way to check a mover or a movemap global parameters is by printing them. Most of the time, these objects `__repr__` methods are organized like a dictionary, or in the case of datadescriptors could be seen as a `pandas.DataFrame`. The goal would be to have a `pyrolyse.digest()` function wich could take any kind of PyRosetta object and, based on their `__rep__` and other magic methods, outputs a dict. Could always be interesting to access not everything but a part of global informations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pyrolyse limits\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is impossible to revert back to PyRosetta pure behavior after pyrolyse import. It is a false problem, though: except in particular cases like testing or comparing before and after import it shouldn't be a major issue. It only makes it mandatory to keep the same behavior through an entire script, which sounds like a sane practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pose_from_sequence and other functions defined in python, or methods from data-descriptors, break as methods are transformed in non-callable attributes. What has been done now was to rewrite these methods and function, but in the case of functions they can't be monkey-patched, so they are only redefined. A `pose_from_sequence` working with any kind of Pose can be found in `pyrolyse.utils`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- parmed or other packages integration are broken upon pyrolyse import. It is only a matter of taking their source-code and suppressing a few parenthesis in front of attributes, so it can be easily fixed, yet functions still have to be rewritten.

    "## Why this name?\n",
    "\n",
    "It stands for PyRosetta lysis, given it tries to digest PyRosetta. Also, as of October 2020 it was not a name taken on PyPI. Finally, its diminunitive `lys` stands for lilies in French. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyrosetta.rosetta as ros\n",
    "import pyrolyse.all as lys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is the promise of a flowery code. (`rose` as a diminutive of `pyrosetta.rosetta` was rejected, because of healthy laziness upon writing one more character but also due to its similarity to `pose`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why an independent package?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many incentives for not writing pyrolyse as a PyRosetta module, or commiting it as direct changes to PyRosetta API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To keep PyRosetta backward compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To be free of Washington University Academic License<br>\n",
    "   And hopefully make it possible to publish it on PyPI, so that installing it is as easy as `pip install pyrolyse`, and public on GitHub so anyone can easily contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Because PyRosetta is big<br>\n",
    "   Current pyrolyse probably covers less than a percent of what lies in PyRosetta. Given that \"transforming methods to attributes\" and such rely on rules like \"not if it is a verb\", the process can probably be half authomatized at best and still needs human work behind. So it takes time, and before it is fully done (if it ever is, as Rosetta is an ever growing software) it is probably better to let people choose whether they want to use it or not, and to explicitly specify when they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Because PyRosetta doesn't need to get bigger<br>\n",
    "   At least not for matters as trivial as optional syntax. If someone doesn't dim pyrolyse worth the shot and won't use it, then better leave the choice of whether it should be installed or not.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Because as it is a young independant initiative developed by a single person its relevance is hard to judge<br>\n",
    "   So it better stay as independant as possible for now, this way if no one cares I can still make it grow depending on my uses, and if a few people find it interesting we can make it grow depending on ours."
